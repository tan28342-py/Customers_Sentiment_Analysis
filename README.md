Step-by-Step Explanation
Getting the Data:

The first part of the code connects to a database (which is like a digital storage space where lots of information is kept) to retrieve customer reviews. These reviews include details like:
The ReviewID (a unique number for each review),
The CustomerID (the ID of the customer),
The ProductID (the product being reviewed),
The ReviewText (what the customer wrote about the product),
And the Rating (how many stars out of 5 the customer gave).
Sentiment Analysis:

Sentiment analysis is a way to figure out if a piece of text (like a review) is positive, negative, or neutral.

For example, if a customer says “This product is amazing!” the sentiment is positive.
If they say “This product is terrible,” the sentiment is negative.
If they say “The product is okay,” the sentiment is neutral.
The code uses a special tool called VADER to analyze the sentiment of each review. This tool looks at the words used in the review and assigns a score to show how positive or negative the review is.

Categorizing Sentiment:

After calculating the sentiment score, the code combines it with the rating the customer gave (1-5 stars).
If the review has a positive score and the rating is 4 or 5 stars, it is classified as positive.
If the review has a negative score and the rating is 1 or 2 stars, it is classified as negative.
If the review has a neutral score and the rating is 3 stars, it is classified as neutral.
Reviews with mixed feelings (for example, a positive score but a low rating) are placed in a mixed category.
Grouping Sentiment Scores:

To make it easier to understand, the sentiment scores are grouped into buckets or ranges.
For example, reviews with a score between 0.5 and 1.0 are categorized as strongly positive.
Reviews with a score between -0.5 and 0.0 are categorized as strongly negative.
Saving the Results:

After analyzing all the reviews, the code saves the results in a new file. This file includes:
The original review details (like ReviewID, CustomerID, ProductID, etc.),
The SentimentScore (a number showing how positive or negative the review is),
The SentimentCategory (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral),
The SentimentBucket (the group the sentiment score falls into, like “strongly positive” or “mildly negative”).
